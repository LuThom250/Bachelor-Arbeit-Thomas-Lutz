# Bachelor's Thesis – Symbolic Regression with Reinforcement Learning for Physics-Informed Modeling

This repository contains the source code for the Bachelor's thesis by Thomas Lutz, focusing on the development and evaluation of a method combining Symbolic Regression (SR) with Reinforcement Learning (RL) to discover interpretable physical laws from governing differential equations.

The core of this work was to train an RL agent to build symbolic solutions for the second-order (rod) and fourth-order (beam) ODEs from structural mechanics. The investigation compared two primary strategies: a data-driven approach using data from Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) and a direct physics-informed approach where the agent minimizes the ODE residual. The performance was benchmarked against state-of-the-art tools like PySR and a custom-built Genetic Programming (GPSR) solver.

## 🚀 Key Findings & Contributions
The experiments led to several key insights into the strengths and limitations of different automated discovery methods:

- **Superiority of the Refined Direct Approach:** The refined, direct SR-RL method was the only approach capable of discovering the exact analytical solution for the complex 4th-order beam equation. This was a task where data-driven methods (SR-RL on PINN data, PySR) and a direct GP-based approach failed.

- **Critical Role of Domain Knowledge:** The application of nondimensionalization was the key to success. It transformed the numerically unstable, high-order beam problem into a well-behaved landscape that the RL agent could solve, demonstrating that physical insight is crucial for automated discovery.

- **Equation vs. Black Box:** In a direct comparison, the refined SR-RL approach delivered more accurate results than a PINN for the beam problem. Crucially, it produced a transparent, symbolic equation instead of a "black box" model, enabling true scientific interpretability.

- **Clear Methodological Trade-off:** The research establishes a clear trade-off: data-driven methods offer generality at the cost of precision (yielding approximate surrogates), while the refined direct approach provides exactness for problems where domain knowledge can be leveraged to ensure numerical stability.

## 📁 Code Descriptions
The core topic of this Bachelor's thesis was the development and investigation of Symbolic Regression (SR) combined with Reinforcement Learning (RL).
To benchmark the proposed method, genetic programming (GP) combined with classical SR techniques was implemented as a reference for performance and interpretability comparison.
Below is a short description of the most relevant scripts and their roles:

**🧪 PySR_Benchmark/**

Scripts for benchmarking the PySR library on basic test functions and PINN-generated data for the rod and beam problems.

**📊 SR-GB_Benchmark/**

A custom Genetic Programming (GP) implementation that directly minimizes the ODE residual and boundary conditions for the rod problem. Serves as a benchmark for the direct SR-RL approach.

**🧠 SR-RL/**

The core implementation of the Symbolic Regression + Reinforcement Learning agent.

- 1.Test_Functions/: Validates the agent on standard mathematical functions.

- 2.Sr-RL_Rod_PINN/ & 3.Sr+RL_Beam_PINN/: Train the agent on data generated by PINNs.

- 4.SR-RL_Rod_No_PINN/: Trains the agent by having it interact directly with the physics (ODE residual) for the rod problem. This is the "direct physics-informed" approach.
  
- 5.SR-RL_Beam_No_PINN/: Trains the agent by having it interact directly with the physics (ODE residual) for the beam problem. This is the "direct physics-informed" approach including nondimensionalisation.

- 6.SR_RL_Validation_Different_Load_Cases/: Validates the nondimensioanlised direct physics-informed approach with different load cases (constsant, linear, quadratic and sinusoidal)

**🧮 Non_DIM/**

These scripts investigate the optimization of physical constants when the symbolic structure of the equation is already known. They compare the numerical stability and accuracy of optimizers on dimensional vs. non-dimensional formulations for both the rod and beam.
