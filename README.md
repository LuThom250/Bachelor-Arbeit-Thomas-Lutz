# Bachelor's Thesis – Symbolic Regression and Physics-Informed Modeling

This repository contains the source code for my Bachelor's thesis, conducted by Thomas Lutz.  
The thesis focuses on the development and evaluation of a novel method that combines **Symbolic Regression (SR)** with **Reinforcement Learning (RL)** to discover interpretable mathematical models.

The SR + RL approach was first tested on classic **mathematical test functions** to assess its general validity.  
It was then applied to data generated by **Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs)** and later extended to **interact directly with a simulated environment**, where expressions were evaluated on-the-fly.

These steps revealed specific challenges in training stability, exploration, and symbolic consistency.  
As a result, several **benchmark methods** – including **genetic programming-based symbolic regression** – were implemented for comparison.

The project also investigates how accurately **physical parameters** (such as elastic modulus or moment of inertia) can be recovered when the **symbolic structure is known**, comparing **dimensional vs. non-dimensional formulations**.

## 📁 Code Descriptions
The core topic of this Bachelor's thesis was the development and investigation of Symbolic Regression (SR) combined with Reinforcement Learning (RL).
To benchmark the proposed method, genetic programming (GP) combined with classical SR techniques was implemented as a reference for performance and interpretability comparison.
Below is a short description of the most relevant scripts and their roles:

### 🧪 PySR_Benchmark/
#### 1.PySR_Test_Functions.py
Applies symbolic regression to basic mathematical test functions using PySR.
Serves as a validation of PySR's capability on known, interpretable functions.
#### 2.PySr_Rod_PINN.py
Uses a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) to model the mechanical behavior of a rod and extracts symbolic models via PySR.
Focuses on learning symbolic solutions guided by physical laws.
#### 3.PySR_Beam_PINN.py
Solves a beam bending problem using PINNs and then applies PySR to discover governing symbolic equations.
Employs realistic physical parameters aligned with the thesis content.

### 📊 SR+GB_Benchmark/
#### GP+DGL+Boundary+Rod.py
Implements a symbolic regression approach based on genetic programming, targeting an elastic rod with physical boundary conditions.
This serves as a benchmark method to compare against the RL-driven approach.

### 🔬 Bingo GPSR Bayesia/
#### bingo.py
Applies symbolic regression using the Bingo framework, which incorporates genetic programming and Bayesian optimization strategies.
It was used specifically for a rod problem, where the input data was generated using a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN).
The goal was to compare the quality of expressions found by Bingo against those from RL-based SR and PySR.

### 🧠 SR+RL/1.Test_Functions/
#### 1.SR_withRL_Test_Functions.py
Trains a reinforcement learning agent to generate symbolic expressions for basic test functions.
The RL policy is guided by rewards based on approximation accuracy.
#### 2.SR+RL_test_functions_(improved).py
An improved version of the above, using optimized hyperparameters and training techniques.
Offers greater stability and better results on complex symbolic targets.

### 🧠 SR+RL/2.Sr+RL_Rod_PINN/
#### 1.SR_with_RL_rod_PINN.py
Combines symbolic regression with reinforcement learning and physics-informed modeling (PINN).
Targets the generation of symbolic models for rod dynamics.
#### 2.Sr+RL_PINN_mehr-Output.py
A variation of the above, including additional visualizations and metrics.
Used for in-depth analysis of the learned symbolic models.

### 🧠 SR+RL/3.Sr+RL_Beam_PINN/
#### SR+RL_Beam_PINN.py
Extends the SR + RL approach to beam bending problems with embedded physical constraints via PINNs.
Aims to extract interpretable models for structural systems.

### 🧠 SR+RL/SR+RL_Rod_No_PINN/
#### 1.SR_with_RL_rod_without_PINN.py
Applies the SR + RL framework to rod dynamics without using a PINN.
Focus is on direct symbolic model discovery from raw data.

### 🧮 Neu_Non_DIM/
#### Rod.py
This script investigates how accurately physical coefficients (e.g., elastic modulus, cross-sectional area) can be identified when the symbolic form of the governing equation is already known.
It focuses on an elastic rod and compares recovery of coefficients in both dimensional and non-dimensional form.
#### Beam.py
Similar to Rod.py, but for a beam bending problem.
The goal is to evaluate how well the coefficients (e.g., E, I, S) can be recovered once the equation structure is fixed — again comparing dimensional vs. non-dimensional formulations.

## 🎯 Thesis Goal
The core objective of this Bachelor's thesis was to design and evaluate a novel Symbolic Regression (SR) framework guided by Reinforcement Learning (RL) to derive interpretable models from physical systems.
As a first step, the method was tested on well-known mathematical test functions (e.g., polynomials, trigonometric expressions).
This allowed for an initial general validation of the approach, independent of physical modeling.
Subsequently, the SR + RL model was trained on synthetic data points generated by Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs).
Later, the method was extended to interact directly with a simulated environment, where the agent evaluated expressions in real time.
This transition introduced notable challenges regarding stability, exploration, and expression reliability.
Based on these findings, a series of benchmark methods, including symbolic regression via genetic programming (GP), were implemented to provide a reference for comparison in terms of accuracy, robustness, and physical consistency.
An additional focus was placed on the identification of physical coefficients when the correct symbolic form of the equation was already known.
To this end, both dimensional and non-dimensional equation formulations were explored and evaluated.
